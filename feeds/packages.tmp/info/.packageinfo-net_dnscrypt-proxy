Title: A tool for securing communications between a client and a DNS resolver
Maintainer: Damiano Renfer <damiano.renfer@gmail.com>
Source: dnscrypt-proxy-1.4.3.tar.gz
License: ISC
Type: ipkg
Description:   dnscrypt-proxy provides local service which can be used directly as your
  local resolver or as a DNS forwarder, encrypting and authenticating requests
  using the DNSCrypt protocol and passing them to an upstream server.
  The DNSCrypt protocol uses high-speed high-security elliptic-curve cryptography
  and is very similar to DNSCurve, but focuses on securing communications between
  a client and its first-level resolver.
