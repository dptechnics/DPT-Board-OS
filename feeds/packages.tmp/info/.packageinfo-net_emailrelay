Title: A simple SMTP proxy and MTA (with OpenSSL support)
Maintainer: Federico Di Marco <fededim@gmail.com>
Source: emailrelay-1.9-src.tar.gz
Type: ipkg
Description:  Emailrelay is a simple SMTP proxy and store-and-forward message transfer agent (MTA). 
 
 When running as a proxy all e-mail messages can be passed through 
  a user-defined program, such as a spam filter, which can drop, 
  re-address or edit messages as they pass through. When running 
  as a store-and-forward MTA incoming messages are stored in a 
  local spool directory, and then forwarded to the next SMTP 
  server on request.

 This package is built with OpenSSL support (SSMTP is supported).
